# py-animation
An animation made in Python that I made for a project in my CS1 Class. I utilized geometry to make the sun, moon, and clock hands move in a circular manner.

The project shows an animation where as a clock moves, a sun and moon rotate around it. As the clock completes a full rotation, the sun and moon rotate a half circle, and continue to rotate. This rotation continues forever.

This project helped me explore animation with Python as well as Geometric concepts so that I could get the clock hands, sun, and moon rotating at a speed consistent with each other. This project also taught me logical thinking as there were several problems that needed to be worked on along the way.
